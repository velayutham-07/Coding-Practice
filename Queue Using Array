#GeeksForGeeks (Basic)

# Implement a Queue using an Array. Queries in the Queue are of the following type:
# (i) 1 x   (a query of this type means  pushing 'x' into the queue)
# (ii) 2     (a query of this type means to pop an element from the queue and print the popped element. If the queue is empty then return -1)

# We just have to implement the functions push and pop and the driver code will handle the output.

# Examples:

# Input: Queries = 1 2 1 3 2 1 4 2
# Output: 2 3
# Explanation: For query 1 2 the queue will be {2} 1 3 the queue will be {2 3} 2   poped element will be 2 the queue will be {3} 1 4 the queue will be {3 4} 2 popped element will be 3 

# Java Code : 

class MyQueue {
 
    int front, rear;
    int arr[] = new int[100005]; 
    int size = arr.length;
    MyQueue(){
        front=0;
        rear=0;
    }
 
    //Function to push an element x in a queue.
    void push(int x){
    // Your code here 
        arr[rear] = x;
        rear = (rear +1) % size;
    } 
 
    //Function to pop an element from queue and return that element.
    int pop(){
    // Your code here   
        if(front == rear) return -1;
        int ele = arr[front];
        front = (front +1) % size;
        return ele;
    } 
}

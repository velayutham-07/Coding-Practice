# GeeksforGeeks (Easy)

# Given two arrays a[] and b[] of equal size, the task is to find whether the elements in the arrays are equal.
# Two arrays are said to be equal if both contain the same set of elements, arrangements (or permutations) of elements may be different though.
# Note: If there are repetitions, then counts of repeated elements must also be the same for two arrays to be equal.

# Java Code :

class Solution {
    public static boolean checkEqual(int[] a, int[] b) {
        if(a.length!=b.length)
         return false;
        Arrays.sort(a);
        Arrays.sort(b);
        for(int i=0;i<a.length;i++){ 
        if(a[i]!=b[i])
         return false;
        }
         return true;
    }
}

# There are n stairs, a person standing at the bottom wants to reach the top. 
# The person can climb either 1 stair or 2 stairs at a time. 
# Your task is to count the number of ways, the person can reach the top (order does matter).

# Java Code :

class Solution {
    int countWays(int n) {
        // your code here
        if(n == 1) return 1;
        if(n == 2) return 2;
        if(n == 3) return 3;
        if(n == 4) return 5;
        int a = 1;
        int b = 2;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 3;i<=n;i++){
            res = a + b;
            a = b;
            b = res;
        }
        return res;
    }
}

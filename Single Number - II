# LeetCode 137 (Medium)

# Given an integer array nums where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. 
# Find the single element and return it.
# You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

# Java Code :

class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
       int once = 0; int twice = 0;
       for(int i : nums){
        once = (once ^ i) & ~twice;
        twice = (twice ^ i) & ~once;
       }
       return once;
    }
}

#You are given an array arr of size n - 1 that contains distinct integers in the range from 1 to n (inclusive). 
#This array represents a permutation of the integers from 1 to n with one element missing. 
#Your task is to identify and return the missing element.

#Java Code:
 class Solution {
    int missingNumber(int arr[]) {
        int n = arr.length +1;
        long expectedSum = (long) n * (n + 1) / 2;
        long actualSum = 0;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            actualSum += num;
        }
        return (int) (expectedSum - actualSum);
    }
}

#Note : Included long since there might be overflow of expected sum.
